          <h3>In-N-Out Secret Burger Menu</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 by 4: If cheese is your thing, order a “1 by 4” burger. You’ll get 1 beef patty and 4 slices of American cheese.</li>
            <li>2 by 4: Order this bad boy and you’ll get 2 beef patties and 4 slices of cheese. Essentially it’s a Double-Double with double the cheese.</li>
            <li>3 by Meat: If cheese ain’t your thing, but meat is, order a “3 by Meat” and get 3 beef patties and no cheese.</li>
            <li>3×3: A burger with 3 patties and 3 slices of cheese. Let the magic begin.</li>
            <li>4×4: 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese. This is the biggest burger you can get at In-N-Out burger. They won’t do a 5×5 or 48×48 any more.</li>
            <li>Animal Style Burger: A burger with grilled onions, pickles, extra spread, and a mustard grilled patty. The spread is a mixture of mayo, ketchup, and sweet pickle relish. You can get any burger “Animal Style” and enjoy the explosion of flavors.</li>
            <li>Chopped Chilies: Ask for it and get hot yellow peppers (kinda like pepperoncini peppers, but hotter) on your burger.</li>
            <li>Cold Cheese Burger: If melted cheese isn’t your thing, ask for cold cheese on your burger.</li>
            <li>Cut in Half (MONEY SAVER): Splitting a burger? Ask for it “cut in half.” Great for feeding little kids as it’ll save you money and you’ll have less waste.</li>
            <li>Double Meat Burger: This one is on the official In-N-Out secret menu page but is a bit of a head scratcher. Isn’t double meat basically a “double double” burger minus the cheese?</li>
            <li>Double Single: Order your next burger “double single” and you’ll get 2 beef patties and a single slice of cheese.</li>
            <li>Extra Everything (FRUGAL FAVORITE): When you order your burger with “extra everything” they’ll give you more lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion at no additional charge.</li>
            <li>Extra Salt: If your blood pressure isn’t high-enough already, order extra salt and they’ll sprinkle a little more sodium on your patty for free.</li>
            <li>Extra Toast: I love their toasted buns. If you want them a little extra toasty, just order your burger “Extra Toast”.</li>
            <li>Fly-Away Burger: Order this if you’re traveling and don’t have time to eat. They’ll wrap your burger (and condiments) in separate packages so you can reheat and assemble when you reach your destination.</li>
            <li>Flying Dutchman: 2 slices of melted cheese sandwiched between 2 beef patties. That’s it. Bon appetit.</li>
            <li>Flying Dutchman (Animal Style): The same as above with grilled onion, pickles, and spread on top.</li>
            <li>Flying Dutchman Workaround: Since In-N-Out will no longer do anything bigger than a 4×4, a simple workaround is to order a Flying Dutchman with your burger and just add it yourself.</li>
            <li>Grilled Cheese: A burger with cheese without any meat. You can order it with whatever veggies or condiments you want or get it with bread and cheese only.</li>
            <li>Medium Rare: Order it if you want a little pink in the middle of your burger patty.</li>
            <li>Mustard Grilled Patty: This one is really delicious. They’ll start cooking your patty, spread some mustard on the uncooked side, then flip it and finish cooking it. When you order your burger “Animal Style” they’ll automatically do this for you.</li>
            <li>No Salt: They sprinkle salt on your patty while they’re cooking it. If you don’t want any, just say “No Salt”.</li>
            <li>No Toast: If you want your bun “un-toasted” you can get that too. </li>
            <li>Protein Style: a burger without the bun. They wrap it all with a couple large leaves of lettuce.</li>
            <li>Side-Salad (FRUGAL FAVORITE): If you’re really craving a meat burger, but still want the health benefits of the veggies, order your burger with a “side-salad” and they’ll put the lettuce, tomato, and onions in a separate burger bag for you.</li>
            <li>Veggie Burger (or Wish Burger): No veggie patties at In-N-Out. Their veggie burger comes with NO patty at all. At least ask for extra tomato or diced chili peppers to spice things up a little.</li>
            <li>Well Done: If you prefer your burger to resemble leather, order that sucker “Well done”.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="col-md-4">
         <h3>In-N-Out Secret Fries Menu</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Animal Style Fries: Fries with melted cheese, spread, and grilled onions. Word of warning: You’re probably going to need a fork or you’re going to end up wearing it. Also, I would recommend mixing it all together before the cheese starts to coagulate.</li>
            <li>Roadkill Fries: This is when you get a Flying Dutchman burger dumped on top of your Animal Style fries. To remind you, a Flying Dutchman is 2 slices of melted cheese sandwiched between 2 beef patties.</li>
            <li>Cheese Fries: Regular fries with melted cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Well Done Fries: Order this if you like your french fries crispy.</li>
            <li>Extra Well-Done Fries: Really crispy fries, almost potato chip in texture.</li>
            <li>Light Fries: If you like your fries a little under-cooked in nature, light fries are for you.</li>
            <li>Light-Well Fries: When you order this, the french fries are cooked between regular and well done.</li>
            <li>2-Minute Fries: Ask for these and they’ll cook the fries for 2 short minutes and serve them to you. They’ll be warm, crunchy, and a little raw in the middle.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>In-N-Out Secret Drink Menu</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ANY Soda Float: In-N-Out will happily make you a soda float with a vanilla milkshake combined with the soda of your choice.</li>
        <li>Chocolate-Vanilla Swirl: A milkshake made by swirling chocolate and vanilla milkshake together, also known by some employees as a “black & white”. </li>
        <li>Lemon-Up: A refreshing combination of equal parts lemonade and 7-Up.</li>
        <li>Large Shake: This is a milkshake in the medium sized soda cup.</li>
        <li>Large Shake Cut-In-Half (MONEY SAVER): Order this and save money on a milkshake by having them split a large into two separate cups. A lot cheaper then ordering two small milkshakes, and you’ll get close to the same amount.</li>
        <li>Extra-Large Shake: This is a milkshake poured into a large soda cup. I’m guessing it comes in at right around 750 calories.</li>
        <li>Neapolitan Shake: This is a milkshake made of equal parts vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry milkshake.</li>
        <li>Rootbeer Float: This sounds awesome. It’s simply a vanilla milkshake combined with root beer to make heaven on earth.</li>
        <li>Tea-ade: A favorite with older generations, this is a mixture of lemonade and iced tea. Also known affectionately as an Arnold Palmer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-N-Out Secret Condiment Menu</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Onions: You can go nuts with the onions. They’ll serve them to you fresh or grilled and you can ask them to be diced or whole. You can also get crazy and ask for any combination on your burger, including grilled and fresh. </li>
          <li>Pickles: The only time when your burger will come with pickles is when you order it “Animal Style”. If you want pickles, but not all the other stuff that comes with “Animal Style”, simply add them to your burger order for no extra charge.</li>
          <li>Spread: If you’re a fan of their spread, which is a mixture of mayo, ketchup, and sweet pickle relish, you can ask for extra when ordering and they’ll throw in a few packets for free. Great for dipping french fries. </li>
          <li>Yellow Chili Peppers (Hot): If you like your burger to have some extra kick, ask for chopped chilis on it, or a side of yellow chili peppers and you’ll get a little packet with two peppers in it.</li> 
        </ul>
