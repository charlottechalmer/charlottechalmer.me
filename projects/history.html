Harry's devotion to his associates, who are treated as family, is as important as his core values of cleanliness, quality and service. The innovative spirit that inspired Harry to develop the Two-Way Speaker for drive-thru customers, and the commitment to quality he demonstrated by thoroughly inspecting and selecting meat and produce every morning in the early days, have contributed to a legacy that will carry In-N-Out toward the next century guided by an unwavering dedication to its customers.</div>
